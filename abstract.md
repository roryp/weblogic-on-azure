# WebLogic on Azure Linux Virtual Machines

Microsoft and Oracle have partnered to provide a set of robust and up-to-date solutions for running WebLogic on Azure Linux virtual machines. These solutions allow Azure users to much more easily lift-and-shift WebLogic workloads to Azure. The solutions support simple use cases such as easily creating a single working WebLogic instance. They also support common use cases such as clustering, load-balancing as well as database connectivity.

This introductory session will overview these solutions including a demo. We will also cover the longer-term roadmap for WebLogic on Azure including encompassing use cases such as securing WebLogic using Azure Active Directory, consolidated logging using ELK and caching using Oracle Coherence - as well as ensuring WebLogic runs well on the Azure Kubernetes Service.
